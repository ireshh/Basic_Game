# Night Excursions
You find yourself running from a relentless monster lurking in the night.
How did you get here? No Idea, but you are here now in this dimension where you can jump boundaries to the other side.
Your need to collect all your coins scattered across this dimension and run as fast as you can to the door to stay alive.
However, reaching the door is no easy task and you can only unlock it when you collect all the coins. Beware, as the monster is hot on your heels,
and if it catches you, it's GAME OVER...

Use the arrow keys to control the player.
